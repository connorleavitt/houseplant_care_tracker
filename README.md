# Houseplant Care Tracker

This fullstack React CRUD app, utilizing MongoDB, Express, and Node as the backend, offers user auth (registration, tokens, etc) to view their plant information. The user has the ability to create, edit and delete their plant profiles.

As a houseplant enthusiast, tracking each plantâ€™s information overtime was a challenge. I wanted a way to organize each plant's information in a clean and reviewable way.

## Plant Profiles

A plant profile provides detailed information on a specific plant, such as a photo, general info, plant care needs, fertlization, common issues and notes.

A user can view all other user's highlevel plant information on the home screen. When they want to view their plant profiles more deeply, they can simply navigate to the plant profiles section or click on a specific plant. A plant profile can be created, updated or deleted easily by the user.

## User Auth

This web app has a registration and login gatekeeping the site with authorization and authentication built in.

A user can update their name (first / last) in the account settings section. This view also shows more infomation, such as stats (account age, # of plants, etc.)

## Future Work

1. Add Watering, Fertilization, and Propagation sections / schedules.
2. Add comments to your own plant profiles
